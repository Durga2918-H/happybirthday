      To my Love,

When I first saw you, it was as if time stood still my heart found its home in you, a place I never knew I was searching for until that moment.

When you gave me the first ring on my birthday, it wasnâ€™t just a gift, it was a vow written in silence,a promise I keep close to my soul. From then on, I knew I loved you more than anything, more than anyone.

I will never leave you. I will always care for youâ€”not as your mom, dad, brother, relatives, or friends, but as your only oneâ€”the one meant to hold you, to lift you, to carry you as my dearest treasure.

For now, I may not be able to change what weighs on your heart, but I promise that one day I will. One day, I will be your strength, your comfort, your family, your everything.

I love you, my dear LOML, with a love that is constant as the dawn, steady as the tide, and endless as the sky.<br>

Forever yours,<br>
Dugaa Hanan
